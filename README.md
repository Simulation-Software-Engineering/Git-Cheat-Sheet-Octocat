# Git Cheat Sheet Octocat

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This project aims to provide a comprehensive git cheat sheet. This contains both the most important commands for beginners and advanced commands found useful by contributors.

In particular, it has been created in the context of the lecture "Simulation Software Engineering" in the winter semester 2021/22 at the University of Stuttgart. Therefore, the main focus here is not to provide a cheat sheet useful for every Git user. Rather, this project serves the purpose of learning the git workflow in larger teams.

Here everyone can start in a small way to contribute to an open-source software development. Imperfect contributions should be developed by the community and provide a learning effect for everyone who contributes to this project.
